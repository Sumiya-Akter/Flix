### User Stories
The only issue I had with this project was when I kept getting an error about UIView. It turned out to be an error from when I was contral dragging an outlet. I didn't do it properly, and so the function ended up not working until it was fixed.

##Notes
The project was very interesting and fun to work with, since this is my first time making an app like this. 
It was a litle hard to work with cocoa pods because it was not running with my computer at the time until I realized 
that I need to download an older version to run with my OS Mojave laptop.
